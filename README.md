# What is Monstralia?
Gamifying good healthy habits for kids! Children ages 2-6 take control of a baby monster avatar and teach it to make healthy choices. Using the HealthStart Foundation's curriculum Healthy Education for Youngsters (HEY), we are making a game using the Unity game engine to teach children how they can take care of their body through healthy eating and exercise.

# If you would like to contribute
All current development is on the 'BrainstormLagoon' branch and the 'master' branch is for finalized changes. If you are new to version control, please check out the YouTube links at the bottom. Please check out the Wiki to familiarize yourself with the structure of the game and the procedures.

## Setup:
### Check out the [Setting Up Unity for Monstralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7IWprAU3A0) YouTube video for an easier guide.
* Clone the repo to your local machine.
* Run "git checkout unity" to switch to the unity branch.
* Download the Unity game engine from https://unity3d.com
* Go to your clone of the repo then /Assets/Scenes and click on any of the .unity files.
* Unity should open and automatically import the project named "Monstralia."
* We are currently developing Monstralia for iPad, and we need to tell Unity this. Go to the menu bar then File->Build Settings, click on iOS, then click the "Switch Platform" button in the bottom left corner of the Build Settings window. (The Unity logo should be next to iOS now).
* If any of the assets (images, sprites, etc.) do not show up inside of Unity, go to Assets (in the menu bar, not the directory inside of the project) and select "Reimport All."

## Documentation:
* We are using a combination of comments in our code and text documents in the GitHub Wiki/Google Drive to document our code.
* We previously used Doxygen to document our code (for how to use doxygen, see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html). 
* To view our old documentation, go to the html directory, and open "index.html" with your favorite browser
